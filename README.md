# Code from: Demography and linked selection interact to shape the genomic landscape of codistributed woodpeckers during the Ice Age

Code used for analyses in Moreira et al. 2022:

### Read alignment, variant calling, and filtering
`

### Population structure

### Demographic inference

### Genetic diversity, recombination rates, and linkage disequilibrium

### Genomic predictors of regional variation in nucleotide diversity

### Natural selection and genetic load
